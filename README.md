# Udacity DAND : Explore US Bikeshare Data

## Project Objective and Importance
This Python code imports the bikeshare data for three major US cities—Chicago, New York, and Washington—and provides descriptive statistics about the data. It takes in raw input from the user to create an interactive experience. Users can customize what kind of data they want to see.

Such analysis is useful not only for bikeshare companies that seek to analyze their bike share usage patterns but also for entrepreneurs who want to gain insight into the "sharing-economy" business which have become increasingly commonplace over the past decade.

## Required Files
You will need the following three city dataset files:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington_csv

## Project Requirements
Solicit user input regarding:
- Which city they would like to analyze
- Whether they would like to filter the data by month, day, both, or not at all

Provide the following bikeshare statistics:
- **Popular times of travel**
  - most common month
  - most common day of week
  - most common hour of day
- **Popular stations and trip**
  - most common start station
  - most common end station
  - most common trip from start to end
- **Trip duration**
  - total travel time
  - average travel time
- **User info**
  - counts of each user type (customer or subscriber)
  - counts of each gender (male or female)
  - earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth
 
 In addition:
 - Be able to handle typos and unexpected inputs
 - Be able to provide the raw data when asked by user
